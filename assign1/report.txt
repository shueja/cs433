CS 433 Assignment 1 report
Jeremiah Shue

The priority queue for this assignment was implemented with a binary heap. This data structure is chosen due to `O(log n)` time complexity on both insertion and removal. It is also the internal choice for the C++ std::priority_queue for this reason.

For the timing results of test 2, this implementation ran in 0.85 to 0.87 seconds on the author's WSL virtual machine, and 0.45 seconds on Gradescope.
This is far from the 0.1 seconds threshold for extra credit, but below the 1 second requirement. I was expecting faster performance, since the STL uses a heap structure as well.
